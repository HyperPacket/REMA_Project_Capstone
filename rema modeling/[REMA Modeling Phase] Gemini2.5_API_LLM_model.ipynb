Extracting Relevant Rent Examples (Amman only, converted to Monthly Price):**\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Description: 180 m2, 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, unfurnished, monthly, semi ground floor, 0-11 months (building age).\n    *   Location: Amman, Jubaiha\n    *   Price: 450 JOD/month\n    *   Price per m2: 450 / 180 = 2.5 JOD/m2\n\n*   **Example 8:**\n    *   Description: 45 m2, Studio (1 bedroom implied), 1 bathroom, furnished, monthly, first floor, 1-5 years (building age).\n    *   Location: Amman, Al Rabiah\n    *   Price: 250 JOD/month\n    *   Price per m2: 250 / 45 = 5.56 JOD/m2 (approx)\n\n*   **Example 10:**\n    *   Description: 140 m2, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, unfurnished, yearly (4200 JOD), third floor, 20+ years (building age).\n    *   Location: Amman, Mecca Street\n    *   Price: 4200 JOD / 12 months = 350 JOD/month\n    *   Price per m2: 350 / 140 = 2.5 JOD/m2\n\n*   *(Note: Examples 1 and 6 are \"daily\" furnished rentals. When converted to monthly (x30), they yield 750 JOD. Ex 6 (50m2, 750 JOD) gives 15 JOD/m2, which is significantly higher than Ex 8 (45m2, 250 JOD) at 5.56 JOD/m2 for similar furnished studios. This suggests Ex 6 might be an outlier or represent a very premium short-term rental. For a \"Monthly Rent PRICE\", Ex 8 is a more direct comparison for furnished monthly rentals.)*\n\n**2. Identifying Patterns:**\n\n*   **Unfurnished Apartments (Amman):** Examples 3 and 10, both 3-bedroom apartments, show a consistent price per square meter of **2.5 JOD/m2**. This rate appears stable across different building ages (0-11 months to 20+ years) and floors (semi-ground to third floor) for unfurnished 3-bedroom apartments in Amman.\n*   **Furnished Apartments (Amman, Monthly):** Example 8, a furnished studio, shows a price per square meter of **5.56 JOD/m2**.\n*   **Furnishing Premium:** Comparing the furnished (Ex 8) and unfurnished (Ex 3, Ex 10) rates, the furnished price per m2 (5.56 JOD/m2) is approximately 2.224 times higher than the unfurnished price per m2 (2.5 JOD/m2). (5.56 / 2.5 = 2.224).\n\n**3. Applying Patterns to the Target Apartment:**\n\n*   **Target Apartment Features:** Amman City, Um El Summaq, 133m2, Furnished, apartment, 2nd floor, 2 bath, 3 bed, building age is 10-19 years.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the equivalent unfurnished price for the target apartment.**\n    Using the consistent unfurnished rate of 2.5 JOD/m2 for 3-bedroom apartments in Amman:\n    133 m2 * 2.5 JOD/m2 = 332.5 JOD\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply the furnishing premium.**\n    Using the multiplier derived from the furnished vs. unfurnished rates (2.224):\n    332.5 JOD * 2.224 = 739.58 JOD\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider other factors (Building Age, Floor, Location).**\n    *   **Building Age:** The unfurnished rate of 2.5 JOD/m2 was consistent across a wide range of building ages (0-11 months to 20+ years). The furnished example (Ex 8) is 1-5 years old, while the target is 10-19 years. Given the pattern, age does not seem to be a strong factor influencing the price per m2 in these examples.\n    *   **Floor:** The examples cover various floors (semi-ground, first, third), and this factor also doesn't show a clear pattern for price variation.\n    *   **Location:** Um El Summaq is a desirable area in Amman, comparable to or potentially slightly more upscale than Al Rabiah (Ex 8) or Mecca Street (Ex 10). This might slightly increase the price, but without a clear pattern for location-based adjustments, we rely on the calculated rate.\n\n**4. Final Prediction:**\n\nBased strictly on the patterns identified, the calculated monthly rent is 739.58 JOD.
